## `SwiftUI` NavigationLink bug?

The link only works once.

* Recreation steps:
1. Select a note from list, the note is then presented in a detail view.
2. Click the note account link.
3. Go back
4. Click on the note account link again, and voila there you have it, not possible to use the link.
5. You can use the link if you go back to the notes list and start over.


I found the same issue on the [developer forum](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/125979)
